          The School of Foreign Languages ​​was founded in 2005 in Kyiv. Before
          that, I taught English for many years. I saw the problems that arise
          when learning, and I understood that with the classical approach with
          an emphasis on grammar, few people “reach the finish line” and only a
          few can use the language in practice. I had my own methods of how to
          talk a person, but I wanted to improve it. I always had a question to
          which I tried to find an answer: “How can any adult person learn in a
          short time not just to read, write and do exercises, but to
          communicate in English?” After all, usually adults do not have time
          for a long study - they need the language right now for work, travel,
          communication with foreigners.

          The School of Foreign Languages ​​invites everyone to study English
          and other European languages ​​in a comfortable environment, with
          professional teachers and an effective methodology. We have been
          working on the Ukrainian market for more than 9 years and offer a high
          level of teaching, a professional approach to language learning, in
          addition, a positive communication experience and new acquaintances.
          During the period of our cooperation with students, we managed to
          become one friendly family, we communicate not only at the level of
          classes, but also outside of school hours.
